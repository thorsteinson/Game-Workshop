          <p> Thanks for coming!  Stick around for the next two hours and
            learn how to program a game.  It's actually not that hard at
            all.  If you're ever lost or need help, ask John, Caleb, or Clara
            for help.
          </p>
          <p> The first thing you need to do is get into groups.  We
            recommend teams of 2-4, but if you want to go solo, or have a
            bigger party, we won't stop you.
          </p>
          <p> The next step is to figure out what level your at.  There
            are two tracks you can follow: beginner or advanced.  Their
            outlined below, and it's important that you choose the one that
            best represents your skill level, otherwise you'll be bored or
            lost.  If choose one and decide later that you don't like it,
            don't be afraid to switch to the other!

                  <p> This uses Scratch, a visual programming language
                    designed designed by MIT. Everything is done completely
                    through the web browser, and nothing has to be downloaded.
                    It comes with an easy to use interface, that beginners will
                    love.

                  <p> This uses Python and OpenGL.  It provides you with a
                    working (basic) clone of minecraft, and points you in
                    directions you can take to extend and modify it.  You could
                    play with OpenGL and try to modify the graphics, or could
                    extend the logic of the game.
