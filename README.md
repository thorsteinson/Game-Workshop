# Game-Workshop
Website for an event to teach game programming to UW students. While the website serves as a stand-alone resource,
it's designed to be used interactively with a group.

## Beginner
No prior coding experience required

Uses [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu/) and builds a _very_ simple game demo. Introduces the concepts of:
- Variables
- Loops
- Control flow
- Boolean logic
- Drawing to screen

This section starts with nothing, with the goal of creating a working demo from scratch (pun intended).

Additional resources are provided to move students in the right direction and keep them on the path of programming.

## Advanced
Uses a simple Python minecraft clone as a base, with the goal being to extend it in some way. Instead of teaching
basic programming concepts, it assumes that students have the knowledge and teaches game programming concepts:
- Textures
- OpenGL
- Game loop
- Interaction logic

The goal is to understand how it works, and extend it in a meaningful way.
