          <h1>Advanced Mode: Let's Modify Minecraft!</h1>
          <p> This mode is much more of a hands off approach. You have to
            be motivated and willing to explore. The tools you have access
            to can do anything, it's just a matter of experimenting. So
            let's get started!
          </p>

          <h2>Setup</h2>
          <p> To run the game, you need Python 2.7 (not 3 or above),
            Pyglet, and of course, the actual game itself.  The Github page
            for the code documents the installation process, but I will
            outline how to do this.
          </p>

          <h3>Python</h3>
          <p> If on Windows, then download and Install Python 2.7 from
            the <a href="http://python.org/download/releases/2.7.6/"> Python
              releases page </a>. If you're on Mac or Linux, then you likely
            already have Python installed, but could download it either from
            that page or your package manager.
          </p>

          <h3>Pip and Pyglet</h3>
          <p> Pip is a Python package manager, and is the easiest way to
            get Pyglet on any system. For Windows,
            install <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/pydatalog/python/pip-for-windows">
              from here </a>, and then install Pyglet. For Macs, go to the
            terminal and execute the following command: <code>sudo
              easy_install pip && pip install pyglet</code>. For Linux,
            install pip with your package manager of choice, and
            then <code>pip install pyglet</code>, just as it's done on the
            Mac.
          </p>

          <h3>Minecraft</h3>
          <p> <a href="https://github.com/fogleman/Minecraft"> The Github
              page </a> for the project has a very extensive set of
            instructions that can help if you get lost at the other steps,
            and outlines what the project is. To get the source code, it
            is <strong>highly recommended that you use git</strong>. Git is a
            version control system that allows you to edit code and save
            progress in increments, allowing you to undo any mistakes that
            you make over time, and build of other projects. Source control
            is an absolute necessity for any project, so you might as well
            start learning it now if you
            haven't. <a href="http://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1">
              Here is a fantastic 15 minute interactive tutorial</a>, but if
            you really don't care, then here's
            a <a href="https://github.com/fogleman/Minecraft/archive/master.zip">
              zip file with all of the code</a>.
          </p>

          <h2>Running the Game</h2>
          <p> To run the game, first open up a terminal and go to the
            directory where the source code is located.  This is wherever
            you cloned the repository, or unzipped the code. The directory
            contains the following four files:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>LICENSE</li>
            <li>main.py</li>
            <li>README.md</li>
            <li>texture.png</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Once in the directory, execute the following command to start
            running the game: <code>python main.py</code>.  If the
            terminal outputs the following:
          </p>
          <pre>
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "main.py", line 6, in &lt;module&gt;
    from pyglet import image
  File "/usr/lib/python3.3/site-packages/pyglet/__init__.py", line 249
    print '%s%s %s' % (indent, name, location)
          </pre>
          <p>
            Then that just means it's running Python3 by default.  Instead
            execute <code>python2 main.py</code>, and it should run
            properly. Once the game runs, you should see a blank 800x600
            blue window pop up on the screen for a few seconds, while it
            generates the blocks for the world, and then you should be
            able to move around!  Here is what it looks like:
          </p>

          <p>
            <img src="img/minecraft-start.png" class="img-rounded img-responsive"
                 alt="What the window looks like when the world is initially
                      loaded" />
          </p>

          <h3>Controls</h3>
          <table class="table">
            <tr>
              <th>Key</th>
              <th>Action</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>W</td>
              <td>Move forward</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>S</td>
              <td>Move backward</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>A</td>
              <td>Strafe left</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>D</td>
              <td>Strafe right</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Tab</td>
              <td>Enter flying mode</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Esc</td>
              <td>Exit window and move mouse</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Left Click</td>
              <td>Remove block</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Right Click</td>
              <td>Add block</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>0-3</td>
              <td>Switch block type</td>
            </tr>
          </table>

          <h2>Extending the Game</h2>
          <p> Now that you actually have the game running on your
            computer, the fun part starts! Modify the source code.
            Absolutely everything that runs the game is in the
            file <code>main.py</code>, and it is heavily commented and
            outlined so that you can start to understand how it works. After
            messing around in the game for a bit, start trying to
            familiarize yourself with the source code and understand how it
            works. Then start to modify it. Here are some suggestions:
          </p>

          <h3>Change Terrain Generation</h3>
          <p> The world that the game generates by default is kind of
            small and boring.  See if you can make it larger.  Try to make
            it more random.  Maybe add a few structures.  The code for
            generating the blocks begins on line 152. 
          </p>

          <h3>Add More Blocks</h3>
          <p> There's only three blocks that you start with.  So adding
            more is going to require modifying the textures file provided,
            and then extending the source code.  Blocks in this version of
            minecraft aren't unique, they all behave the same but have a
            different texture.  Try make blocks their own unique object,
            that can be extended.  Look at the real Minecraft as an example.
            What makes blocks different, and what are their properties?
            Here's a few that come to mind:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Gravity</li>
            <li>Sounds</li>
            <li>Mine rate</li>
            <li>Explosive durability</li>
          </ul>


          <h3>Change the Laws of Physics</h3>
          <p> The physics for the game are mainly controlled by several
            constants in the class.  What happens when you mess around with
            these?  How does the game change when you edit terminal
            velocity, gravity, etc.?
          </p>

          <h3>Change the Rendering</h3>
          <p> The game is rendered in real time through OpenGL, a language
            that provides direct calls to the graphics card to do any sort
            of visual operation quickly.  Pretty much all video games take
            advantage of OpenGL for any graphics intensive work.  Look at
            the methods of the class with the name <code>draw</code>, and
            try to figure out how they work.  OpenGL itself is an entirely
            different language with it's own quirks, but you can probably
            mess around and see how to get it to work.  Try to draw the
            article in another color, or maybe instead of having a rectangle
            appear on the selected block, make that block glow brighter.
          </p>

          <h3>Add Enemies</h3>
          <p> This is probably the most complex of anything suggested so
            far, because it requires a huge amount of extra work. Not only
            do you need to model how the different enemies would interact
            with the world through AI, but you <em>also</em> would have to
            animate the models for them. But if you did it, it would
            awesome. You might be able to look at Minecraft mods to find 3D
            models for various types of enemies, or you could just do
            something as simple as have a red flashing block that chases you
            around.
