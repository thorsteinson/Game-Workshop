          <h1>Beginner Mode: Let's Learn Scratch</h1>

          <p> This will go step by step on how to create a basic wall
            bouncing game.  You will be able to start a game, keep track of
            a high score, and move a paddle to try to bounce a ball back
            and forth against a wall.  While it may not seem like much, a
            simple game like requires a decent understanding of how games
            work, and will teach you the fundamentals of how to get into
            more interesting things.
          </p>

          <p>
            A working copy of the finished game can be found
            <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/18319490/" target="_blank"> here </a>. You can use this as a
            reference if you get lost, or extend this working version
            afterwards! The great thing about scratch is that the code for
            all of the games can be "remixed" into whatever you want it to
            be! Be sure to check out the popular scratch games and see how
            they work.
          </p>
          
          <h2>Go to the website</h2>

          <p> Begin by going to the scratch website
            located
            <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tip_bar=getStarted"
               target="blank">here</a>.
            This interface provides you with everything that you need to
            start building a game from scratch. Start by familiarizing
            yourself with the interface. Look around, press different
            things, see what happens. Scratch provides a built in tutorial,
            but I'll explain the elements of Scratch as we need to use them,
            so you don't have to follow it.

          </p>

          <h2>Make a Sprite</h2>

          <p> Sprites are all of the characters and drawn objects in
            Scratch games.  When create a new Scratch project, it will
            always come with a sprite of a cat.  Our game isn't going to use
            the cat, so we need to get rid of it.
          </p>

          <h3>Deleting Sprites</h3>
          <p> Select the cat sprite first by clicking on it in the Sprites
            window in the left bottom corner.  It has the name "Sprite1".
            Once that is selected, click the "Costumes" tab in the main
            editing window.  This is where all sprites are created and
            modified.
          </p>
          
          <p> Delete the two costumes for the existing cat, by clicking
            the "x" box in the upper right corner of each respective
            costume. Once deleted you should see a blank canvas, that looks
            like the following:
          </p>

          <p>
            <img src="img/empty-sprite-canvas.png" class="img-rounded img-responsive"
                 alt="Blank sprite canvas" />
          </p>

          <h3>Draw a Rectangle</h3>
          <p> Click the paint brush icon to enter creation mode. You then
            will be able to start drawing a new sprite. Select the rectangle
            button and draw a tall and narrow rectangle. It shouldn't be too
            large. Try to keep the height around 100 pixels.
          </p>
          <p> After creating the rectangle outline, use the fill button to
            fill it with paint, and make it solid.  You technically don't
            have to, but it looks better.
          </p>

          <h2>Making It Move</h2>
          <p> Now we have our paddle, which is just a black rectangle.
            But the paddle doesn't do anything, which is boring.  Luckily,
            making it move is really easy.
          </p>
          <h3>Programming in Scratch</h3>
          <p> Click the "Scripts" tab, right next to the "Costumes" tab to
            access the scripts editor.  In scratch, each sprite has
            different scripts which are used the program the sprites.  All
            of it is done through drag and drop!  Click events, to get the
            event pieces, and then grab the "when space key pressed" block.
          </p>
          <p> This block will perform whatever action is attached when the
            given key is pressed.  Change it from "space" to "up arrow," so
            we can make this move up when we press up.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img src="img/up-down-logic.png" class="img-rounded pull-right" alt="Up
                                                                                 down logical blocks" />

            Now go the motion events, and add a "change y by 10" block.
            This block will adjust the y position of the paddle by 10.
            That's a reasonable default for us, so attach it to our other
            block. Now when you press up on your keyboard, the paddle will
            also move up! If it goes too far up, what you may need to do is
            grab it with the mouse to pull it back down. Now add the pieces
            to make the block move down. Just grab blocks like before, but
            change the values so that they will perform the correct action.
            When finished, you should have the following two logical
            blocks:
          </p>

          <h2>Adding A 'Ball'</h2>
          <p> Before we can do anything more interesting, we need to have
            a ball that the paddle can interact with.  Create a new sprite,
            and make a square.  Don't make a circle, because the edge
            detection for that is actually very difficult.  Also give a
            different color than the paddle, so it's easy to see the
            distinction between them.
          </p>

          <h3>Ball Logic</h3>
          <p> The ball should do several things. It needs to move around
            in a linear way, bounce around when it hits a wall, and
            disappear when it hit's the wall behind our paddle.
          </p>

          <p>To do this, we need to start what is known as an event loop.
            We will pass various signals around, and then have the ball
            react based on those signals. To create the event loop, go to
            events section, and add the green flag event.  This is a special
            flag, that basically starts when the game is run.  Then under
            that add a forever block from the control section.  What this
            does is create an infinite loop, that constantly checks the
            given conditions when the game is running
          </p>

          <h3>Adding variables and conditions</h3>
          <p> We need a way to get the ball to move around, so we have to
            have need to use variables to keep track of it's velocity.  Go
            to the data blocks, and click "make a variable," call it "xVel"
            and say that it's only for this sprite.  Do it again for another
            variable and name it "yVel".  This will keep track of our ball's
            speed and direction.
          </p>

          <p>
            <img src="img/variables.png" class="img-rounded pull-right" alt="Start of
                                                                             the event loop for the ball" />

            Now that we have a velocity, let's make the ball move based
            on that velocity. In our event loop, add two motion logical
            blocks.  One to change x by our x velocity, and another to
            change y.  Then add two logical right before our event loop, and
            after the green flag is clicked, that randomly set the x and y
            velocity variables.  When finished, click the green flag, and
            the ball should start moving!  Here is what my event loop looks
            like so far:

          </p>

          <p> At this point, we can begin adding conditions in our event
            loop to get the ball react to the bouncing walls.  When it hits
            the top wall or bottom wall, the y velocity should flip, so that
            it starts to move the other way. When it hits the right wall,
            the x velocity should flip.  We'll save when it hits the panel
            and the left wall for later.  Here's what the condition is for
            the top wall, see if you can figure out what the rest are.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img src="img/bounce-condition.png" class="img-rounded"
                 alt="Bounce condition for the lower wall"/>
          </p>

          <h3>Reacting to the Paddle</h3>
          <p> So now we have a ball that will bounce around three of our
            four walls, but if it hits the paddle, it just goes right
            through it.  We now will implement the logic to get paddle to do
            what it was destined for.
          </p>

          <p>In an ordinary programming language, we would normally
            compare the positions of the sprite to see if we needed to
            bounce them, but there is a more convenient method in Scratch.
            We can see if it's touching another color!  This is why it's
            important that the ball and paddle are two different colors.
            Go to the Sensing section, and grab a "touching color" block.
            You can select any color by clicking something on the screen.
            Create another condition, and use this new logic block to
            change the velocity as we did before.</p>

          <p> One thing to note, is that you should flip both the x
            velocity <strong>and</strong> y velocity.  The reason is that if
            you don't and the block touches the top of your paddle, it
            will ride through to the opposite of the panel, before being
            launched away behind it.  Flipping both of the velocities will
            fix this behavior
          </p>

          <h2>Game Over</h2>
          <p> Right now, if we we're to add the last wall condition to the
            event loop, we wouldn't have anything to add. That's because we
            need a way to reset the game when it finishes. To do that, we
            have to modify what we've created so far, and start using event
            broadcasting.
          </p>

          <h3>Sending and Receiving Messages</h3>
          <p>

            We've already been using a few events so far.  The flag, and
            the movement for the paddles are examples of events created
            through interaction with the keyboard and world.  However, we
            have the ability to create our own events, and react to them how
            we want.
          </p>

          <p> What we'll do is add a "reset" event.  This event will do
            basically set the game up back to an initial start position.
            All this really means given the state of our simple game is that
            we put the sprites back in their starting positions.
          </p>

          <p> When the ball hits the left wall, it should broadcast a
            reset message, which will then put everything back in it's
            initial state. It would also be good to have it wait, so that
            players have some time to prepare before the ball first
            launches. Additionally, our flag event should just broadcast the
            reset message, which will go to the event loop for us. If you
            manage to do this, you will essentially have a working game!
            Here's what my logic looked like for the paddle and the ball:
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <img src="img/finished-paddle.png" class="img-rounded
                                                      img-responsive" alt="Completed paddle logic" />
          </p>

          <img src="img/finished-ball.png" class="img-rounded pull-right"
               alt="Completed ball logic" />
          
          <h2>Now What?</h2>
          <p> You may have made the game, but there's still so much more
            stuff that you can add. Sounds, visual effects, score keeping,
            any number of things really. What you add is limited by your
            imagination.  The ball could paint a trail as it moves around.
            It could move faster each time it bounces off of the paddle.
            There's much to be done to make the game better!
          </p>

          <h3>Look at other Scratch Games</h3>
          <p> The Scratch Website
            has <a href='http://scratch.mit.edu/explore/?date=this_month&amp;order_by=love_count'>
              many other projects</a> , all of which give you the ability to
            modify and extend their source. Some of them are kind of goofy,
            but others are surprisingly sophisticated.
            This <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/17341536/"> Flappy
              Bird Clone </a> is a great example of how flexible Scratch is.
          </p>

          <h3>Learn a Real Programming Language</h3>
          <p> Scratch is very simple, and while it's easy to get started,
            it can only take you so far before it's limitations will begin
            to show.  That's why it's probably much better to learn a
            programming language that's capable of <strong> anything</strong>!
            Here's some great languages to learn as a beginner:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>Javascript/HTML5: Javascript isn't as heavy duty as most
              other languages, but the great thing about it is that it's
              portable.  Anyone with a web browser can play your game,
              and you learn web development at the same time!</li>
            <li>Python: Python is a fantastic language to start
              learning, because it's popular, forgiving, and simple.  It
              doesn't have static typing like other languages, making it
              easy to experiment with.</li>
            <li>Java: While it's not the prettiest or easiest to learn,
              Java probably the most widely used programming language in
              the world, so it's easy to find resources for help.  Even
              Minecraft is written in java.  Also, it's the main language
              for Android development, giving you a route to mobile games</li>
          </ul>
